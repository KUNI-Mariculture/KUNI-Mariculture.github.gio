This visualization represents a collection of recent economic and nutritional information. You can explore each variable separately, and then the variables at the end of the drop-down menu represent combined scores. A country's Total Mariculture Opportunity Score is based on its combined economic and nutritional opportunities, and the country's reliance on seafood for essential nutrients.
