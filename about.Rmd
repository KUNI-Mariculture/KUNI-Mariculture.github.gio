Kuni Fellowship Proposal

Group members: Patricia Faundez-Baez, Owen Liu, Renato Molina, Molly Wilson

Faculty mentor: Ben Halpern

Research Questions: What are the economic incentives, environmental considerations, and human nutrition values driving the choice and production of maricultured species in the largest producer countries? 
Are there tradeoffs in mariculture production between profitability and environmental and human health?
Are there species currently not farmed that may better balance these tradeoffs than those currently produced?
Are there lessons arising from these tradeoffs that are relevant to other nations currently in the nascent stages of aquaculture development?
